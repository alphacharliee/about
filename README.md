# Hey, I‚Äôm Albert C√°rcamo

I‚Äôm a self-taught builder and coder with the help of AI. Exploring how a simple idea can turn into something real.  
Born and raised in Honduras, Central America, where I'm currently based.

I come from a legal background, but two years ago I started coding, something I always hoped I‚Äôd learn one day.  
AI made that possible. It helped me build with little knowledge, first out of curiosity, then because I realized how much it could automate and simplify parts of my daily life. Since then, I‚Äôve spent most of my free time building systems that mix LLMs, APIs, and practical use cases in finance, automation, and daily workflows.

## What I‚Äôve Built

### TradeMesh ‚Äî 
A Discord bot that gathers financial news, gainers, losers, and helps users analyze chosen stocks to find which companies might move the market.  
It includes a GPT-based sentiment analysis and entity recognition module to summarize real-time market signals.  
- Stack: Python, spaCy, OpenAI API, Discord.py  
- Goal: give traders inside Discord servers market context without digging too much, a kind of AI financial guide for decision making.

Alongside TradeMesh, I created a Discord community for fellow Hondurans from scratch focused on finance, crypto, and AI 
It started from a few investment and crypto posts I interacted on Reddit, and in less than a year it‚Äôs grown organically to almost 60 members, a small number maybe, but big for a country where these topics in 2025 are still just starting to gain traction. Inside the server, I built a custom GPT access bot connected directly to the OpenAI API. It lets certain trusted users run commands right from Discord and interact with ChatGpT... a free ‚Äúinsight‚Äù service I offer to the original members who helped the server grow.  

It‚Äôs become a small but active space where people share market ideas, tools, and experiments, and it‚Äôs been awesome to watch others in my country start to explore finance, crypto and AI.

### Jeff ‚Äî WhatsApp Personal Finance Assistant  
My crown jewel.
A personal finance bot that helps track your budget, expenses, and income with a single WhatsApp message.
Jeff connects WhatsApp ‚Üí Google Sheets ‚Üí User, keeping data fully private while automatically organizing it for analysis and habit tracking.  
- Fully private ‚Äî all data stays in each user‚Äôs personal Google Sheet  
- Focused on simplicity, privacy, and financial awareness

### Aether Quant Toolkit  
My first attempt at a quant playground. Aether is a Python toolkit that uses Monte Carlo simulations to estimate price probabilities for crypto assets. It fetches data, runs technical indicators, and produces probability-based forecasts.  
- Stack: Python, yfinance, pandas, matplotlib  
- GPT helps summarize outcomes and interpret risk

### CalendarBot (Luna)  
An AI scheduling assistant built for a real Pilates studio.  
Luna is a WhatsApp-based bot that uses an LLM to automate bookings and confirmations. It reads messages like ‚Äúbook me tomorrow at 10,‚Äù checks Google Calendar, and replies with confirmations or alternatives ‚Äî even sending follow-up emails.  
- Built with Twilio + GPT + Google Calendar API + Google Mail  
- Handles bookings, reschedules, confirmations, and FAQs

## Why I Build

Since early on, I‚Äôve had a close connection to technology, mostly by breaking things first. After a few ruined motherboards from plugging cables where they didn‚Äôt belong, I found a real passion for software and how it could make life easier. At 15, I got my first Google AdSense check for running a small tech blog and channeling traffic from YouTube videos back in 2007-2008. Fast forward a bit and life took me through law school and into aviation law, where I‚Äôve worked for the past decade.  

When coding assistants and LLMs became public, that spark just reignited...hard. I started experimenting again this time using AI as my coding partner and ended up building projects that mix automation, finance, and everyday use cases.  That path led me here. It‚Äôs hard to say what‚Äôs not possible anymore with AI, and I‚Äôd love to join a team of like-minded builders to explore that further. I've had a focus on **coding with AI, automation, and finance** but open to explore other areas making tools that feel natural to use, not over-engineered, just useful and smart

## Why I‚Äôm Applying

This fellowship feels like the kind of thing I‚Äôve already been doing on my own for the past two years. I started building with AI out of curiosity, trying to see what I could make with GPT and some APIs. I don‚Äôt have a computer science backgroundm just the drive to try, fail, and keep learning.

Most of what I‚Äôve built came from that. A few Discord bots, a WhatsApp finance assistant, some automation tools, and a small Discord community focused on finance, crypto, and AI.

What I like about this fellowship is that it‚Äôs not about degrees or titles, it‚Äôs about actually building things. That‚Äôs what I love doing: taking ideas and turning them into something real.  
AI tools changed how I think and how I work, they made coding possible for me, something that used to feel far away. Honestly, I‚Äôd love to join a team that shares that same drive and curiosity to keep pushing and making ideas a reality.
