# Hey, I‚Äôm Albert C√°rcamo

I‚Äôm a self-taught builder and coder with the help of AI exploring how AI can make real things faster, smarter, and more human.  

I actually come from a legal background, but a couple of years ago I started coding, thing i had a hope to one day conquer it, AI helped me build with little knowledge, first out of curiosity, then because I realized how much AI could automate and simplify random things in my daily life. Since then, I‚Äôve dedicated my free time to build systems that mix GPT models, APIs, and practical use cases in finance, automation, and daily workflows.

## What I‚Äôve Built:

### TradeMesh ‚Äî AI for Market Intelligence

As well a mode to answer based on query or order like sequence and multiple texts..
- Built with Twilio + GPT + Google Calendar API + Google Mail

## Why I Build  
Since early on in my life ive had a close contact to technology after several motherboard ruined by connecting cables where they didnt belong, managed to find a passion for software and trying it early on and try to squeeze the best out of it while making my life easier, received at 15 years old a check from revenue from google ads program for running a tech blog and running ads on it chanelling traffic from youtube videos (2007), fast forward that kid after life decisions that kid ended up in law school and have been working within the aviation law sector for the past 10 years, since coding agents and LLMs became publicly avaible decided to reignite my passion for technology, software and else and started to code with AI help, taking me to this application, today its hard to say whats not possible to do with the help of AI, would love to join a team of like minded individuals and explore and bring new ideas to life, right now My focus is a mix of **codigng with AI help, automation, and finance** making tools that feel natural to use ‚Äî not over-engineered, just useful,smart and making your life easier.

## Why I‚Äôm applying

This fellowship feels like exactly the kind of thing I‚Äôve been doing on my own for the past two years. I started building with AI out of curiosity, trying to see what I could make with the help of GPT and some APIs. I don't have a computer science background, just the drive to try, fail, and keep learning. Most of what I‚Äôve built came from that. A few Discord bots, a WhatsApp finance assistant, some automation tools, and a small Discord finance, crypto and AI community that‚Äôs grown to almost 60 people here in Honduras all organic from Reddit posts. Inside that server, I even made a bot that lets certain users run GPT commands straight from Discord. It‚Äôs kind of a free service I give to the older members who helped me grow it.

What I like about this fellowship is that it‚Äôs not about degrees or titles, it‚Äôs about actually building stuff. That‚Äôs what I like doing. I like to take ideas and make them real, It's crazy that AI tools changed how I think and how I work, and being honest it made coding feel possible for me, something that seemed distant. I‚Äôd love to be part of a team that‚Äôs exploring that drive in people and pushing it further.
