TradeMesh started as a weekend project to bring market context straight into Discord. 
It uses GPT to read and show financial news, detect tickers, 
and summarize sentiment so traders can see whatâ€™s moving the market without leaving the chat. 
As well as detect unusual movements in certain stock options.
