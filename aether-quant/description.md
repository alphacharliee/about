## Aether Quant Toolkit

Aether is a Python-based toolkit built to explore probabilistic forecasting and risk modeling for crypto assets.  
It fetches live market data, calculates key technical indicators, and runs Monte Carlo simulations to estimate 
price probabilities and volatility over time.

It started as an experiment to understand how traders use quantitative methods to test strategies and support 
decision making in the crypto space.  

Aether runs locally and is published on GitHub as a simple CLI tool for quick analysis and experimentation.
