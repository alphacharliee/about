Luna CalendarBot is a WhatsApp automation bot built in Python, designed to manage a Pilates studioâ€™s scheduling workflow. 
It integrates the Twilio WhatsApp Business API for messaging, Google Calendar API for real-time appointment management, and Google Sheets as a lightweight CRM backend. 
The bot uses GPT-powered natural language understanding to interpret messages and handle multi-step conversational flows such as booking, rescheduling, and canceling. 
It also sends automated email confirmations and enforces slot limits (4 per hour) for efficient studio operations.
A regular query style (menu-guided interaction) has been enabled and is currently under trial by the studio, with plans for official deployment soon
