# Jeff — WhatsApp Personal Finance Assistant

Jeff is a privacy-focused personal finance bot that helps you track your budget, expenses, and income through WhatsApp.  
It connects WhatsApp → Google Sheets → User, keeping everything private while organizing transactions automatically and sending quick summaries.

Jeff uses natural chat prompts — no forms, no fixed commands.  
Users can just say things like “I bought lunch for 120” or “Got paid today,” and Jeff handles the rest.

**Highlights**
- Privacy focused all data stays in each user’s personal Google Sheet.
